    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs are some of the easiest food to make, but they can be
        quite difficult to get <em>perfect</em>.</p>
    <p>In this recipe, I will show you how to make the best scrambled eggs in
        just <strong>five minutes</strong>!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>You will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs,</li>
        <li>milk or water - milk will give you a creamier texture, but
            water works fine,</li>
        <li>butter,</li>
        <li>salt and pepper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack your eggs into a medium bowl, and whisk until the yolk and
            whites are combined.</li>
        <li>Pour in a quarter cup of milk, and whisk again! The eggs should 
            be an even yellow color, with no spots or streaks.</li>
        <li>Gently preheat the pan, and melt a small knob of butter in it.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture in and let it cook for a few seconds, undisturbed.</li>
        <li>Pull a spatula across the bottom of the pan to form curds of eggs.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking, making sure to scrape the sides of the pan so that the
            eggs do not dry out.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are mostly set, remove the pan from heat.</li>
        <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper. Now you have perfect scrambled eggs!</li>
    </ol>
