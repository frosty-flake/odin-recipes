    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>

        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a large pot of lightly salted water. Cook spaghetti in the water,
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, for about 12 minutes.
            Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir
            until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels, reserve
            bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over
            medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook till fragrant,
            about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Return cooked bacon to skillet with spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through.
            Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly until eggs are barely set.
            Add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley and extra Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
